# Portfolio
 
Right now there are two project in this portfolio: the Airbnb data project, and the MNIST data project

Airbnb data project:

The aim of this project is to analyse the data of Seattle's Airbnb listings obtained from the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science. 

The following lybraries are used in this project:
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib
4) sklearn
5) statsmodels
6) seaborn
7) re
8) os
9) imageio
10) tensorflow

There are several files in this project, some generated by the notebook (Airbnb_full_project.ipynb) and some used as an input for the notebook. The files used as an input for the notebook are:

1) Seattle_map2.png, to generate some images relating the map to the airbnb listings
2) Seattle_calendar.csv: data of the last ~2 millions event of bookings.
3) Seattle_listings.csv: data with the general features of all the listings in seattle up to 2017. There is a little bit less than 4000 listings.

Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to Simone Centellegher who provided on his github a beautiful way to plot bar graphs, which I usually find rather dull. link accessable on Jan/27/2020: https://scentellegher.github.io/visualization/2018/10/10/beautiful-bar-plots-matplotlib.html




MNIST data project:

This as small and concise project on the tensorflow dataset of handwritten digits. In this project I aim to concisely model the dataset in order to predict handwritten digits. The dataset has basically no need for preprocessing, which is perfect for the goal of this project. I used a part of a course I've done in Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/) as the basis for this project.

The following lybraries are used in this project:
1) numpy
2) tensorflow
3) tensorflow_datasets

There is only one file in this project and it is Complete_MNIST_dataset_done_by_me.ipynb.

By the end of the project I show that I manage to have an accuracy of about 98% on predicting new handwritten digits.

I would like to express my gratitude to 365 Careers Team for the very good course.
