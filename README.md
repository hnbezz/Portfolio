# Portfolio
 
 I have added several examples in this portfolio of what I am able to do within Data Science, including (but not limited by) Linear Regression for insights in car markets, Logistic Regression for image recognition, TensorFlow applications and Supervised Machine Learning.

The aim here is not to show with how few lines I can perform an action, but what are the thoughts behind the actions taken.
