# Portfolio
 
Right now there is only one project in this portfolio, the Airbnb data project. 

The aim of this project is to analyse the data of Seattle's Airbnb listings obtained from the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science. 

The following lybraries are used in this project:
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib
4) sklearn
5) statsmodels
6) seaborn
7) re
8) os
9) imageio
10) tensorflow

There are several files in this project, some generated by the notebook (Airbnb_full_project.ipynb) and some used as an input for the notebook. The files used as an input for the notebook are:

1) Seattle_map2.png, to generate some images relating the map to the airbnb listings
2) Seattle_calendar.csv: data of the last ~2 millions event of bookings.
3) Seattle_listings.csv: data with the general features of all the listings in seattle up to 2017. There is a little bit less than 4000 listings.

I would like to express my gratitude to Simone Centellegher who provided on his github a beautiful way to plot bar graphs, which I usually find rather dull. link accessable on Jan/27/2020: https://scentellegher.github.io/visualization/2018/10/10/beautiful-bar-plots-matplotlib.html
